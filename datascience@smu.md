Repo's related to school projects. These are either mine or ones I've contributed to.

### Data Mining
This <a href="https://github.com/RahnL/DataScience-SMU/tree/master/DataMining">repo</a> has various assignments from the Data Mining class.
The code is in ipython/Jupyter notebooks.
- <a href="https://github.com/RahnL/DataScience-SMU/blob/master/DataMining/DataMining%20-%20Lab%202%20-%20Lieberman-Melendez-Rogers.ipynb">Project 2</a> is a large project with various techiniques outlined
such as KNN, PCA, and Random Forest.

### Quantifying the World
This is one of the final classes in the program which goes through a half-dozen real-world problems.
Some of these are listed here. (We didn't do all of them via Github)
- <a href="https://github.com/RahnL/QuantifyingTheWorld/pull/1">Assignment 1</a>

### Visualization
I had two classes in visualization, where we used Processing, Java, C++, and D3 and html to create visualizations
#### Project
One of the final projects is a map for <a href='http://MyWorldOfCoke.com/map.php'>My world of Coke</a>, showing a database 
driven map of countries I have a can/bottle of coke from.

The initial program was written in c#/ASP.net for the database connection to Azure, with the front end in Javascript and D3.

I later moved this to the domain, and re-did the backend to be in MySQL with PHP to access it.

The repo showing both versions is <a href='https://github.com/RahnL/MyWorldOfCoke'>here</a>.  (Note the Azure site is no longer up.)

#### Project
Another project we did was trying to visualize a resume. This uses a D3 to make a tree showing connections between skills and where they were used.
