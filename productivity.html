<h1>My path to productivity.</h1>
<p>I thought it would be fun to track some of the stuff I'm doing as I go down the path of learning all about data science, machine learning, and artifical intelligence.

<p>
While this isn't everything I've done,it's a taste...</p>

<h3>7/8/17</h3>
<li>Decided to start this log. </li>
<li>Been working on using linux for day-to-day stuff, so better learn vi/vim. Decided on this instead of emacs because I just want a 
text editor. May do emacs down the road, since I've been interested in doing stuff in lisp since 1989. Watched enough of a lynda.com 
course to get me in and out, and will watch the rest later once I've used it a little</li>
<li>Python for Data Science Udemy course. Been working on this. Made it a bit further along</li>
</p>
<p><h3>Previously</h3>
<li>May, 2017-Finished Masters degree</li>
<li>various Udemy hours and trying to build stuff on my own.</li>
